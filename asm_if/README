					ASM IF CHALLENGE
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

For this assignment, you will need to implement an if statement
in assembly with as high a speed as possible.

You will write a function called asm_if, which will take four
ints as parameters (that will get passed in as R0 through 
R3 as usual). It will return an int as a return value, which
will be 1 if true, or 0 if false.

In C, booleans are ints, and ints are booleans. (They're not
separate types like in C++.)

You will implement the following C function in assembly:
int asm_if(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    return ((a | b) && (c | d)) || ((a | ~d) & (~b & d));
}

You will write a program purely in assembler that will do the
same thing as the C function above. Your function will be run
many many times and tested for both correctness and speed.
